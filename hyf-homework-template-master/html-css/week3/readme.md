## Homework Week 3

In the folder “wireframes” you find wireframes for a signup flow for a website that finds special deals on clothes, handbags and accesories based on users personal preferences.

The signup form is fairly complex and broken into 4 steps in order not to scare away users.

The task is to recreate this form in HTML and CSS. You should focus on using the right HTML form widgets for the job, applying the general layout. There is no visual design provided, so you can choose colors etc. but no points are awarded for good or bad design so it is suggest that you just leave all of the form input with the stock styling and only try to refine this if you have completed all other tasks.

Notice that there is some “state-based” functionality, such as the ability to hide and show a custom shipping address, if the billing and shipping address is not the same. Try to apply the “checkbox hack” that we used in class today to achieve this (https://css-tricks.com/the-checkbox-hack/)

<!-- Currently you are expected to create 4 separate HTML files and set up links between them using anchor (<a>) tags. If you feel like trying out some more techniques learned in class today, try instead putting the 4 different form steps into tabs using the library we learned to use today. Or you can also create tabs using the checkbox hack.  -->
You need to use the basic skelton markup already created for you in this folder. Just look in the html and fill in the missing form elements. It also has a reference to a javascript file. You should not look at this file and only trust that it works as intended as long as you insert the elements in the html as described in the html. 

There is a progress bar that will indicate how far the user is. If you have time, try to use CSS transitions to animate it so the bar goes from 0-1 on the first page, 1-2 on the second page and so on (with a smooth and nice animation).

Below is an overview of the fields in the form and how they should be validated. To figure out the right regular expression pattern try googling for something like ("regex only letters") and use something like [this website](https://regexr.com/) to test that the pattern you have found works correctly.
